# Art History Quiz
This repository is home to a project meant to help refresh myself on major movements of art history, specifically painting, as well as giving others an interactive way to learn. 

## Goals of this Project
1. Simplify key stylistic information about various painting movements
2. Identify a selection of major painters from each movement with notable works
3. Compare differing approaches to the same idea to highlight distinguishing features
4. Develop identificaton quiz to let users identify which major art movement a piece belongs to
